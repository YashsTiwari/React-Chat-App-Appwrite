#Real Time Chat App using React + Appwrite

This chat app contains features like real time messaging and deleting. It's a global chat, where any logged-in user can post and delete message.

Note- Due to some problem in appwrite, features like registering and verifying user are not added. In case the problem is solved in the near future, then more features will be added.

In case anyone is willing to resolve the appwrite issue, then you are most welcomed, just make a PR after resolving and after reviewing i'll merge it.

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
